                    "content": "This is by far one of the best, if not the best movie about the creation of both Apple and Microsoft and is essential viewing for any tech enthusiast or IT person as it gives you a great and accurate insight into the start of both companies.\r\n\r\nThe portrayal by both Noah Wyle (Steve Jobs) and Anthony Michael Hall (Bill Gates) was flawless as after watching footage of both Jobs and Gates at the time I can say at some points I forgot I was watching a movie and almost felt like a documentary how accurate they portrayed both these real-life legends, also they don't shy away to show that Steve Jobs wasn't a very nice person and Bill Gates is maybe a person you shouldn't trust in any way at the time. Also need to give a shout out to both John DiMaggio (Steve Balmer) and Joey Slotnick (Steve Wozniak) who both narrate a large portion of the film and once again do justice to both of these real-life figures.\r\n\r\nNow the film is a little flawed because it was a made for TV film by TNT and you can tell it had a very small budget, but for what it's worth they tell the story really well with such a small budget and I would love to see a director like Adam McKay redirect this film with a bigger budget but keep the exact same story.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, I urge you to give this film a watch and get ready to learn the true story of how the computer world as we know it was created.\r\n\r\nP.S. If you work for TNT, please beg them to remaster this film if possible."

Over a decade ago, Simon Sinek started a movement that inspired millions to demand purpose at work, to ask what was the WHY of their organization. Since then, millions have been touched by the power of his ideas, and these ideas remain as relevant and timely as ever.<br> <br>START WITH WHY asks (and answers) the questions: why are some people and organizations more innovative, more influential, and more profitable than others?

Academy LMS advertises its plugin and theme as light weight and fast. That might be true, first speed tests were kinda positive, but then I tried to switch the theme and realized that Academy LMS relies heavily on Elementor and even other plugins such as Essential addons. These have a direct influence on performance and make the use of the theme complex. For instance: main menu appears only in an Elementor header and not in the standard menu location.\n    \n      As a result, I switched back to my original MasterStudy settings.\n    \n      Please create Demos based on Gutenberg and nothing else. I expect here beautiful, well-designed homepages.\n    \n      Regarding the booking feature: cool that there is a general availability. But if you work with several instructors, then you need to allow each of them an individual calendar that would apply to all of their courses. Currently, you can only set one booking calendar per course. I believe, it is a very challenging thing to develop a whole calendar, so please integrate with Amelia to solve that.\n    \n      I will keep this for now and observe the development over the next month or so and then decide if I go for a refund or not.

    "description": "As someone who immensely enjoyed Walter Isaacson's biographies on Leonardo da Vinci, Jennifer Doudna, Jobs, Kissinger, Franklin, I was eager to dive into his latest work on Elon Musk. Isaacson's capability to produce such in-depth accounts back-to-back, especially in the wake of a global pandemic, is truly commendable. This biography isn't just another account of a tech mogul's journey; it provides an intimate, unfiltered look into the mind of one of the most polarizing figures of our time, even for readers like me who aren't ardent Elon Musk fans.Isaacson's storytelling prowess shines through as he logically structures the narrative into two distinct yet intertwined facets: an updated account of Musk's life and a close-up look into his daily activities and decision-making processes. The first 60% of the book provides an updated account of Musk's life and accomplishments, seamlessly picking up where Ashlee Vance's book left off. However, it's in the latter 40% where Isaacson truly shines: after following Musk around for two years, he offers readers unprecedented access to Musk's daily life and even his private communications.Isaacson's fearless approach, evident in his earlier works, is on full display here. The book wasn't vetted by Musk, and it shows. From multiple episodes of Musk yelling at staff to him dismissing loyal employees for seemingly trivial reasons, Isaacson presents a balanced, uncensored portrayal.One of the most captivating elements of the book is its deep dive into Musk's unique decision-making processes. This resonated strongly with me, as someone who often questions the status quo at work. It's an eye-opening look at the mindset that has disrupted multiple industries.The biography also dives deep into Musk's more controversial decisions, such as his involvement in geopolitical events like the Ukraine crisis. These insights, much like his previous works, offer readers a nuanced understanding of the complexities involved in such decisions.Isaacson doesn't shy away from exploring the evolution of Musk's public persona, particularly his transformation on Twitter. It's a fascinating look at how one man can leverage, or mishandle, the power of social media platforms.While I may not agree with all of Elon Musk's decisions or methods, this biography reaffirms one thing: the man is a genius. Isaacson's ability to dissect complex personalities has never been clearer. After devouring his works on Leonardo da Vinci and The Code Breaker, I can confidently say that this book is a worthy addition to Isaacson's impressive portfolio.Another must-read from Isaacson, essential for anyone interested in technology, business, and the intricate tapestry of genius.Show more",

    "title": "theInternational on Amazon : Best wireless noise cancelling earbuds I have used so far",
    "description": "I am a long-time user of the Bose QuietComfort 20 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones. These are my favorite noise cancelling option to use while taking walks. I like to listen to audio books while walking and the QuietComfort 20 are superb for this use. I also like to use a noise cancelling option while listening to audio books and podcasts in the car, especially because my car does not contain road noise well. I decided I would like to have a second QuietComfort 20 reserved for use in my car. An additional advantage to having a second one is if anything happens to the one I walk with, I'll have a backup. But, unfortunately, Bose discontinued the QuietComfort 20 forcing me to have to find another option for use in the car.I first purchased the wireless Bose QuietComfort Earbuds. But I found much to dislike about them. They feel heavy in the ears; the buds themselves just feel heavier and less comfortable than the QuietComfort 20 Headphones. I also disliked that every time I put the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds into my ears they speak to me telling me they are trying to connect to my device and also reporting battery state. I found this incredibly annoying. Another thing I hugely disliked was that there is an uncomfortable \"boom boom\" sensation as I walk with them in. I wear Vibram FiveFinger shoes and do not walk with a heavy gait. I do not get this \"boom boom\" sensation when walking with the QuietComfort 20 headphones. I also disliked how big the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds' case was. I disliked how the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds sometimes felt like they weren't secure in my ears and when I would try to adjust their stability I would accidentally change the noise cancellation setting. On two occasions, an uncomfortable high pitched sound emitted from one of the buds; it only lasted for a couple seconds but it was annoying. I tried using the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds for a month and never could bring myself to like them, so I returned them. I now have a strong dislike for Bose, primarily because they discontinued my beloved QuietComfort 20 Headphones. But up until recently, I was a huge Bose fan.I purchased Apple AirPods Pro. I immediately fell in love with the H1 chip operation. But I didn't like the color white. I also didn't like the stalk that extends down. But I started using them thinking I had found my noise cancelling option for the car. And although the AirPods Pro delivered some \"boom boom\" sensation while walking, it was much much better than the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds. Then I started to become aware of a huge problem with the AirPods Pro. They would not stay in my ears. I would place them in ear, hear the noise cancellation activate and then in time the noise cancellation would turn off because one of the pods had pushed out of my ear enough to cause the noise cancellation function to disengage. I found myself constantly having to push them into my ear in an effort to keep them from pushing out. A couple times they plain fell out of my ears. I consulted instructionals on how to properly insert them into my ears for proper fit. I also did the fit test and passed the test indicating I had good seal. Only the seal wouldn't last and the pods would eventually push out of my ears. So I had to return the AirPods Pro because they wouldn't stay in my ears.I purchased some non noise cancelling earbuds thinking that a passive seal would be enough, but I found a number of problems with this option. I didn't like shoving thing way into my ear. Not only was it a little uncomfortable, but I also wondered about the sanitariness of touching (e.g., foam inserts) prior to shoving them into my ear. Maybe this could lead to ear infection? Also, the amount of sound isolation was too good which diminished my situational awareness while walking and/or driving. So passive noise block earbuds weren't solving my use need.I was worried there was no option for the car and I would not have a backup to my beloved QuietComfort 20 headphones. I really wish I could buy another pair of QuietComfort 20 headphones just to have a backup for the future. After delaying and delaying, I decided to go to the trouble to try one last option for the car: the Beats Fit Pro. Eureka!The Beats Fit Pro are fantastic! They have the H1 chip, which is awesome. They fit and feel way better than the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds and are super secure in my ears, unlike the AirPods Pro. The Beats Fit Pro feel so light to wear. I can wear them all day and there is no discomfort. They also have a button to cycle through the noise cancellation options, which I like a lot better than the tapping that was needed on the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds. I also like the button press on the Beats Fit Pro better than the stalk-squeeze on the AirPods Pro.The one edge that I might say the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds have over the others is the noise cancellation. The Bose QuietComfort Earbuds arguably provide more intense noise cancellation that results in more of a bass presence and a sense that the content being played is closer to you. However, there is a cost to this that I don't think is worth it. The biggest cost for me was the \"boom boom\" sensation while walking. I don't know exactly what is to blame for this but it completely ruins the earbuds for what I want to use them for. I found the fit and noise cancellation of the Beats Fit Pro to be better suited to my needs.I wrote this to help others in their quest to find the earbuds that work best for them. I strongly recommend giving the Beats Fit Pro a try. I like them a lot. I think many others will too.ADDENDUM (added 2022-NOV): My beloved wired Bose QuietComfort 20 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones stopped working a few weeks ago. I purchased the wired Bose Headphones many, many years ago and used them a lot, so it was not unexpected. Fortunately, the Beats Fit Pro have been able to replace the wired Headphones for my daily walks. The Beats Fit Pro have minimal \"boom boom\" sensation while stepping/walking. Although the Beats Fit Pro have more \"boom boom\" than the wired Bose Headphones, the \"boom boom\" is minimal and much, much better than offered by the wireless Bose QuietComfort Earbuds. I have been using the Beats Fit Pro in cold weather lately and discovered that the physical side button on the Beats Fit Pro works fantastically when wearing a hat. For example, if I am wearing a thick knit winter hat, I can still activate the side button on the Beats Fit Pro by pushing on the outside of the hat. This can't be done with a touch-operation \"button\" like found on the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds.  The AirPods Pro \"button\" might be more difficult to operate with a hat on too. So if you are intending to use earbuds under a hat or hood, Beats Fit Pro will give you the advantage of still having full, easy use of the side button for play/pause operation from outside the hat.",

We discovered a new “hammer”—foundation models—and unleashed a wave of novelty apps that were lightweight demonstrations of cool new technology.\n\nThe market is entering “Act 2”—which will be from the customer-back. Act 2 will solve human problems end-to-end.\n\nSome companies are already getting into the \"Act 2\" groove. @harvey__ai  is building custom LLMs for top-tier law firms. @Glean is indexing our workspaces to make gen AI more relevant at work. @character_ai and Ava are creating digital companions.\n\nSo this year we're shaking things up! We're organizing our market map by use case, not by model modality. This reflects the market's evolution from technology hammer to actual use cases and value, and the increasingly multimodal nature of applications. \n\nAs with last time, we'd love everybody's help crowdsourcing the map.
